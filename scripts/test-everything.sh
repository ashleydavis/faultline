# Runs the checks this change affects, several at a time, and stops the moment one of them fails.
#
# Called with no arguments it asks what-changed which targets are affected and runs only those, so a
# documentation-only change runs nothing at all. Called with target names it runs exactly those,
# because the caller has already decided. --force runs every target whatever changed.
#
# Nothing here records a baseline. Each target captures its own when it passes, so running one by
# hand marks it up to date exactly as a run from here does, and one target passing never marks
# another as passed.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/test-everything.sh                # only what changed
#   bash scripts/test-everything.sh --force        # every target
#   bash scripts/test-everything.sh --plan         # print the decision, run nothing
#   bash scripts/test-everything.sh compile test   # just those, whatever changed
